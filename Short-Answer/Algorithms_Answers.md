#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This algorithm would be O(n) because of the input size


b) This algorithm would be O(n^3)


c) This algorithm would be O(n).. recursive with n

## Exercise II

So I would start from the bottom floor and move higher up until the egg is broken
If the egg breaks we exit the loop and return the floor
This would run at O(log(n)) complexity.
